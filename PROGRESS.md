# Progress Log

Reverse-chronological session log. Newest entry on top. Records **decisions, surprises, and next steps** — not keystroke-level changes (git has those). Pair each entry with the git commits from that session.

Convention per entry: what we did, decisions made (and why), surprises/breakage, corpus snapshot (from `python ingest/audit_coverage.py`), next steps.

## 2026-06-16 — CBA source verification (MA award cities)

**Did**
- Established and recorded in `CLAUDE.md` the **"verified" standard** for a city's CBA sources: a city counts as verified only when all three hold, each logged in the inventory — (1) a *findable source* (central portal, union local, or a documented FOIA route), (2) a *safety CBA present* in the 2014–2024 window, and (3) a *matched non-safety CBA* from the same city overlapping the same cycle. A city with safety but no in-window comparison is flagged dead weight, not collected.
- Used **Boston as the template**: verified via the city's central Office of Labor Relations (OLR) portal (`boston.gov/departments/labor-relations`), which hosts ~21 bargaining units' CBAs as PDFs (safety + BTU teachers + clerical).
- Verified the other 5 award cities against the standard and updated `data/ma_award_inventory.csv` (added a `cba_source_url` column distinct from the JLMC `award_url`; set `safety_cba_status`, refined `matched_nonsafety_target`, logged source route + quirks). All 5 came back **verified**:
  - **Newton** — verified_portal. City HR union-contracts portal hosts safety + non-safety CBAs; NTA teachers via Newton Public Schools HR.
  - **Quincy** — verified_portal. Safety via JLMC arbitration awards on mass.gov; QEA teacher CBAs posted (quincypublicschools.com / quincyeducationassociation.org).
  - **Arlington** — verified_portal (town). Fire CBA on town HR page; police arbitration-prone (JLMC award); AEA teacher contracts on massteacher.org.
  - **Somerville** — verified_portal. No central city portal; police CBAs via a *completed* MuckRock FOIA release + MA DLR repository; SEU teachers posted. City verified on police.
  - **Worcester** — verified_portal. Single central HR portal hosts fire + police + clerical + DPW CBAs across multiple in-window cycles.
- Moved nothing: the inventory was already at `data/ma_award_inventory.csv` (untracked); it's now tracked.

**Decisions (and why)**
- **`award_url` ≠ CBA source.** The existing `award_url` points to JLMC interest-arbitration awards on mass.gov; those are not the signed CBAs. Added a separate `cba_source_url` so the *source of the contract text* is recorded explicitly, per the verification standard.
- **Worcester matched non-safety switched from teachers (EAW) to clerical/DPW.** EAW teacher contracts are not on the city HR portal (separate school employer, member-gated union site) and would need a c.66 request; NAGE Local 490 (clerical) and Teamsters Local 170 (DPW) are on the *same* portal as the fire CBA across overlapping cycles — a cleaner matched pair, so the target was changed.
- **All 5 logged as `verified_portal`** even where the cleanest safety text is an arbitration award (Quincy, Arlington police) or a FOIA-released PDF (Somerville police): a findable, obtainable in-window source exists for each. Caveats (signed-CBA-vs-award, fire-needs-c.66, scanned→OCR) are written into the row notes, not hidden behind the status.

**Surprises / breakage**
- **No outright FOIA-only or dead-weight cities** among the five — better than expected. The nuance is in *route*, not existence: Somerville has no city CBA portal at all (relies on MuckRock + MA DLR), and Quincy's signed police CBAs (vs. the awards) would still need a records request.
- City/town HR sites (Newton, Arlington) return **HTTP 403 to automated fetchers** — anti-bot. Documents are real and browser-downloadable, so collection will be manual `public_download`, consistent with the no-scraping discipline.
- Heavy **false-positive noise** from same-named places (Quincy IL; Arlington VA/TX/IL) — excluded; only the MA sources retained.
- Somerville police PDFs are scanned scanner output → expect `text_quality = ocr_messy` at collection.

**Corpus snapshot**
- contracts: 0 | discourse: 0 | matched pairs: 0 — unchanged; this was source *verification* only, no downloads. Inventory: 6 MA cities, all 6 `verified_portal` (Boston template + 5 verified this session).

**Next steps**
- Begin **matched collection** from verified sources, safety + its matched non-safety per city, starting with the cleanest single-portal case (Worcester) and Boston.
- For Somerville fire and Quincy signed police CBAs, queue **c.66 records requests** if the award/FOIA-release text proves insufficient.
- Route the first real documents through `inbox/` + `inbox/manifest.csv` + `python ingest/process_inbox.py`; then re-run `python ingest/audit_coverage.py` and update `data/city_coverage.csv`.

## 2026-06-15 — Project setup

**Did**
- Stood up the corpus-construction pipeline: schema (`docs/schema.md`), validator (`scripts/validate.py`), and ingestion layer (`ingest/`).
- Created Python venv, installed `requirements.txt`, installed system deps (poppler, tesseract).
- Initialized local git (no remote for now).
- Verified environment: `ingest/test_pipeline.py` → 18/18 passing; `scripts/validate.py` → passes on empty corpus.

**Decisions (and why)**
- `corpus/` stays **local**, not pushed — licensed (Westlaw/Lexis) and FOIA material can't be redistributed. If a GitHub remote is added later, uncomment `corpus/` in `.gitignore` *before* first push.
- Repo kept local for now; no GitHub remote yet.
- LLM span fallback: using an **Anthropic** key for `llm_pass()` only (Option C); GABRIEL toolchain stays on OpenAI separately. Two keys coexist.
- Clarified scope: this pipeline *builds the corpus*; GABRIEL is the *later* measurement layer that scores it. Distinct stages.

**Surprises / breakage**
- venv creation failed because the parent folder `Pol/Fire` was stored on disk as `Pol:Fire` (Finder shows `/`, filesystem uses `:`, which is the PATH separator). Renamed parent to a colon-free name to fix.

**Corpus snapshot**
- contracts: 0 | discourse: 0 | matched pairs: 0 — empty baseline, environment verified.

**Next steps**
- Run one real CBA through `inbox/foia/` + `inbox/manifest.csv` + `python ingest/process_inbox.py`.
- Inspect the unresolved-spans report to see whether the regex patterns match real contract language (arbitration / comparability / me-too phrasing varies by jurisdiction).
- Begin matched collection: for each safety unit, grab at least one non-safety unit in the same city + cycle.
