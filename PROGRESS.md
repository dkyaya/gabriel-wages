# Progress Log

Reverse-chronological session log. Newest entry on top. Records **decisions, surprises, and next steps** — not keystroke-level changes (git has those). Pair each entry with the git commits from that session.

Convention per entry: what we did, decisions made (and why), surprises/breakage, corpus snapshot (from `python ingest/audit_coverage.py`), next steps.

## 2026-06-15 — Project setup

**Did**
- Stood up the corpus-construction pipeline: schema (`docs/schema.md`), validator (`scripts/validate.py`), and ingestion layer (`ingest/`).
- Created Python venv, installed `requirements.txt`, installed system deps (poppler, tesseract).
- Initialized local git (no remote for now).
- Verified environment: `ingest/test_pipeline.py` → 18/18 passing; `scripts/validate.py` → passes on empty corpus.

**Decisions (and why)**
- `corpus/` stays **local**, not pushed — licensed (Westlaw/Lexis) and FOIA material can't be redistributed. If a GitHub remote is added later, uncomment `corpus/` in `.gitignore` *before* first push.
- Repo kept local for now; no GitHub remote yet.
- LLM span fallback: using an **Anthropic** key for `llm_pass()` only (Option C); GABRIEL toolchain stays on OpenAI separately. Two keys coexist.
- Clarified scope: this pipeline *builds the corpus*; GABRIEL is the *later* measurement layer that scores it. Distinct stages.

**Surprises / breakage**
- venv creation failed because the parent folder `Pol/Fire` was stored on disk as `Pol:Fire` (Finder shows `/`, filesystem uses `:`, which is the PATH separator). Renamed parent to a colon-free name to fix.

**Corpus snapshot**
- contracts: 0 | discourse: 0 | matched pairs: 0 — empty baseline, environment verified.

**Next steps**
- Run one real CBA through `inbox/foia/` + `inbox/manifest.csv` + `python ingest/process_inbox.py`.
- Inspect the unresolved-spans report to see whether the regex patterns match real contract language (arbitration / comparability / me-too phrasing varies by jurisdiction).
- Begin matched collection: for each safety unit, grab at least one non-safety unit in the same city + cycle.
