## 2026-06-30T10:56:17-04:00 - v10 gold dry-run completed

**Commit:** `ed67ffa` (`Dry run v10 prompt on gold set`)

### Current State After This Entry

- Do **not** run the all-32 v10 causal pilot yet.
- The candidate `arbitration_or_impasse_backstop` prompt handled ordinary grievance-arbitration boilerplate reasonably well.
- The gold set needs repair around Arlington-style future reopener/impasse clauses before broader scoring.
- H1 remains plausible but underidentified; v9 and v10 both still require strong source-type caveats.

### Corpus Snapshot

- Contracts: 32
- Discourse rows: 0
- Coverage rows: 32
- City attributes rows: 3
- Cities: 9
- Healthy matched pairs: 12
- Exact-cycle matched pairs: 9
- Overlap-cycle matched pairs: 3
- Exploratory adjacent matches: 0
- Unmatched safety rows: 3
- Unmatched safety obs_ids: `ma_somerville_police_spsoa_2012`, `ma_somerville_police_spea_2012`, `ma_newton_police_2015`

### What Changed

- Added bounded v10 gold-only runner: `analysis/gabriel_pilot/run_gabriel_v10_gold_dryrun.py`.
- Created gold-only input: `analysis/gabriel_pilot/input_v10_gold_2026-06-29.csv`.
- Ran one v10 dry-run on only the 11-row gold set.
- Created results: `analysis/gabriel_pilot/results_v10_gold_dryrun_2026-06-29.csv`.
- Created audit: `analysis/gabriel_pilot/results_v10_gold_dryrun_audit_2026-06-29.csv`.
- Created report: `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_gold_dryrun_report_2026-06-29.md`.
- Updated v10 design memo: `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_arbitration_impasse_design_2026-06-29.md`.
- Updated `PROGRESS.md` and `logs/api_spend_log.csv`.

### Dry-Run Design

- Scope: 11 hand-coded gold rows only.
- Not run on all 32 causal rows.
- Causal rows used existing local source text from `analysis/gabriel_pilot/input_v9.csv`.
- Boston BTU stayed in the separate mechanism-proxy lane and used only existing memo/locator context.
- No documents were ingested, downloaded, or added to `corpus/`.
- No v8/v9 outputs were modified.

### Results

| gold_label | n | scores | mean | min | max |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `clear_positive` | 3 | `96, 96, 88` | 93.3 | 88 | 96 |
| `clear_negative` | 4 | `0, 10, 0, 0` | 2.5 | 0 | 10 |
| `false_positive_trap` | 4 | `20, 70, 10, 15` | 28.8 | 10 | 70 |

Boundary results:

- Clear positives all scored at or above `51`.
- Clear negatives all scored at or below `25`.
- Boston BTU mechanism-proxy negative scored `0`.
- Three of four false-positive traps stayed at or below `25`.
- Formal audit result: 10 of 11 rows passed.
- Retry run: no.

### Main Interpretation

The lone formal failure was `ma_arlington_public_works_2018`, which scored `70` despite being labeled as a false-positive trap. Manual inspection found that the full text contains an Article XXX duration/reopener clause referencing an impasse procedure with mediation/factfinding and money issues. That is not ordinary grievance-arbitration boilerplate.

This means the first dry-run did **not** clearly fail on the main feared prompt boundary. Instead, the Arlington row is probably a contaminated gold row or an unresolved construct-boundary case.

### Decisions Carried Forward

- Do not revise the grievance-arbitration exclusion based on this run; it worked on Boston SENA, Seekonk DPW, and Seekonk teachers.
- Do not proceed to an all-32 causal pilot yet.
- Resolve whether future reopener clauses with mediation/factfinding and money-issue language should count for v10.
- Improve the local v10 relevance screen before broader use; it over-filtered some JLMC/stipulated-award and impasse evidence.

### Recommended Next Codex Run

Repair the v10 gold set before any all-32 causal pass:

1. Inspect Arlington DPW Article XXX and decide whether future reopener/impasse clauses count.
2. Recode Arlington as ambiguous/weak-positive if those clauses count, or add a stricter prompt rule if only invoked backstops count.
3. Add at least one clean grievance-only DPW trap.
4. Add one or two future-reopener/impasse edge cases.
5. Run one bounded gold-set retry.

## 2026-06-29T22:13:16-04:00 - v10 gold set and first handoff created

**Commit:** `4ff2b57` (`Create v10 gold set and ChatGPT handoff`)

### State After This Entry

- The project had a reusable ChatGPT handoff for future planning.
- The immediate recommended next step was to dry-run the v10 prompt on the 11-row gold set before any broader `arbitration_or_impasse_backstop` pass.
- The main implementation risk was false positives from ordinary grievance-arbitration boilerplate in CBAs.

### Corpus Snapshot

- Contracts: 32
- Discourse rows: 0
- Coverage rows: 32
- City attributes rows: 3
- Cities: 9
- Healthy matched pairs: 12
- Exact-cycle matched pairs: 9
- Overlap-cycle matched pairs: 3
- Exploratory adjacent matches: 0
- Unmatched safety rows: 3
- Unmatched safety obs_ids: `ma_somerville_police_spsoa_2012`, `ma_somerville_police_spea_2012`, `ma_newton_police_2015`

### Research Interpretation

- H1 remained plausible but underidentified.
- GABRIEL v9 found its clearest `comparability_emphasis` signal in safety-side arbitration/award-style documents, especially the Somerville police awards.
- Ordinary CBAs and MOAs generally scored low on v9 comparability.
- The strongest non-safety peer-wage comparison found so far was the official Boston BTU bargaining page, but that evidence was mechanism-proxy/discourse-lane rather than causal-corpus reasoning text.
- The central caveat was source type and document production: explicit reasoning appears where institutions force it onto the page, not necessarily wherever it matters in bargaining.

### What Changed

- Created the first hand-coded v10 gold set: `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_gold_set_2026-06-29.csv`.
- Created the gold-set memo: `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_gold_set_memo_2026-06-29.md`.
- Created the first `docs/analysis/chatgpt_handoff_latest.md`.
- Added a gold-set pointer to `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_arbitration_impasse_design_2026-06-29.md`.
- Made a small filename-date cleanup in `docs/acquisition/ma_newton_somerville_boston_mechanism_source_plan_2026-06-26.md`.
- Updated `PROGRESS.md`.

### Gold-Set Composition

- Total rows: 11
- Clear positives: 3
- Clear negatives: 4
- False-positive traps: 4
- Ambiguous rows: 0
- Mechanism-proxy rows included: 1
- Main trap class: grievance-arbitration boilerplate in ordinary CBAs

Positive anchors:

- `ma_somerville_police_spsoa_2012`
- `ma_somerville_police_spea_2012`
- `ma_wayland_fire_jlmc_2020`

Negative/trap anchors:

- Wayland DPW and library ordinary CBAs
- Worcester fire safety-side negative
- Boston SENA, Arlington DPW, Seekonk DPW, and Seekonk teachers as arbitration-boilerplate traps
- Boston BTU bargaining page as a mechanism-proxy negative for peer-wage comparison alone

### Key Artifact Paths

- v9 preliminary report: `reports/6_25/v2/GABRIELv9_preliminary.pdf`
- Public-source strategy note: `docs/hypotheses_public_source_strategy_2026-06-24.md`
- Mechanism-source summary: `docs/analysis/mechanism_source_summary_2026-06-26.md`
- Boston BTU deep dive: `docs/acquisition/ma_boston_btu_salary_comparison_deep_dive_2026-06-29.md`
- Comparator network design memo: `docs/analysis/comparator_network_design_2026-06-29.md`
- Comparator synthesis memo: `docs/analysis/comparator_edge_synthesis_2026-06-29.md`
- Comparator stub CSV: `docs/analysis/comparator_mentions_stub_2026-06-29.csv`
- v10 design memo: `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_arbitration_impasse_design_2026-06-29.md`
- v10 gold set CSV: `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_gold_set_2026-06-29.csv`
- v10 gold set memo: `docs/analysis/gabriel_v10_gold_set_memo_2026-06-29.md`

### Open Decisions At This Point

- Whether the v10 attribute should stay causal-corpus-only for its first run, or whether a separate mechanism-proxy lane should be scored later.
- Whether the 11-row gold set was enough for prompt tuning, or whether a second-round set should add ambiguous edge cases.
- Whether the next empirical priority was a v10 pilot, more comparator extraction, or broader mechanism-source acquisition.

### Recommended Next Codex Run At This Point

Use the gold set to draft and test exact v10 prompt language against the 11 hand-coded rows, with special attention to keeping grievance-arbitration boilerplate near `0` to `1_25` and keeping Boston BTU negative despite its strong peer-wage content.
